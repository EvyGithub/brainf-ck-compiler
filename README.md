# brainf*ck compiler
a brianf*ck compiler that I made for fun and because I didn't have much else to do

## only problem
you can't use multiple lines.
all the code has to be on the first line.

## instructions
1. download `.zip`
2. extract to someplace idc where
3. put your brainf*ck code into the `code.bf` file
4. run `compiler.py` (NOT `compiler-OLD.py`) and the output will be in the terminal

that's literally it
