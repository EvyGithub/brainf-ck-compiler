# brainf*ck compiler

# BEFORE YOU CONTINUE
this is a WIP project. All the characters EXCEPT the loops (`[` and `]`) work. DO NOT try using loops. they will not do anything.

so I made a brainf*ck compiler in python for fun.

## instructions

put your brainf*** code into the `code.bf` file.
then just run the `.py` file. there's a bunch of random `print()` functions for debugging.
